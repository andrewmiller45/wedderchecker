        blurb: "Some of the best bouldering in the state can be found up in the Icicle. The Forestland Boulders, Mad Meadows, and plenty of outlying boulders provide a wealth of terrain to test one's self. The legend goes that there are great boulders within walking distance of any pullout up Icicle Road - and this legend is true! In addition to the hundreds of roadside problems, there are endless boulder-filled plateaus up on the north side of the canyon, dozens of scary riverside highballs and deep/shallow water solos, and plenty of untapped potential on the inaccessible south side of the river and farther upcanyon. The one detractor to Icicle bouldering is the access issues: increased privatization and irrigation development has closed off some areas, so try to keep your impact low on the many sectors that are on or nearby public land. You can find shady woods in the summer, sun-raked plazas in the fall, lonely test pieces hiding on the hillside or busy circuit circuses with room for everyone. Welcome to the Icicle, crown jewel of Leavenworth bouldering."

        blurb: "Gold Bar: the otherworldly pebble-equivalent of the magical Index granite, and the best bouldering near Seattle. Heading west on Highway 2, Gold Bar sits just before some of the more rugged Central Cascades, and is the beginning of a valley full of astounding granite boulders that culminates in the world class Leavenworth. While the stunning Town Walls forming the backdrop to the town of Index get much of the attention, formed from the same clean-cut granodiorite are the Gold Bar Boulders. There are boulders of every size and shape everywhere in the Skykomish Valley. None so perfectly concentrated for scrambling about and upon than those located northeast of Gold Bar, above Reiter Road and below Zeke's Wall. The beloved Forest, Clearcut and Five Star Boulders have honed the technique and strength of Seattle climbers for more than two decades, through countless waves of exploration and development. As mentioned above, the Forest and Clearcut are the main (although not most visited) areas of the Gold Bar Boulders. Nestled between two arms of a decommissioned logging road which stretches 2 miles from Reiter Road, the beautiful old growth forest houses classic problems of every grade, offering sun and shade alike. In past years the logging road allowed vehicles, but easy approaches are no more, and one must park on road pullouts and make the trek. Thus, most of today's attention is focused on the smaller but easier-accessed areas: the heavenly sculpted Five Star Boulder, the River Boulders, and the bouldering at Index. While clambering about on the fine-grained, sharp-angled granite, expect technical aretes, slopey crimps, strenuous compression and some of the best stone you'll ever touch. If you wish for more features on your stone dinner-plate, head east to Der Leavenworth; but to learn to deftly dance upon nothing and pull hard on false promises to your fingers is a reward like no other. Coupled with the unmatched beauty of the Skykomish's dank forests, idyllic river, and intimidating peaks, and the adrenaline disappointment of a car break-in - Gold Bar, your teacher and friend, awaits you."

        blurb: "This zone is comprised of some of the best bouldering in the Bellingham area. There are dozens of problems on Chuckanut Sandstone, with more being developed all the time. Much of the rock in the area is sandstone so, please do NOT climb when wet! Allow 2-3 days after the last rain before climbing. Just because the road is dry does not mean the boulders are.  The boulders are nestled in the trees, and the area is quite aesthetic, as is the approach. Please note that you'll need a Discover Pass to park at the trailhead."
