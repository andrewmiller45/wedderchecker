# Wedder Checker

## Introduction
  - This project was an opportunity to show the current grasp on React.
  - The goal was to pull in local weather data for specific bouldering areas in the state of Washington, routing dynamic GPS coords, to see what the conditions looked like.
  - There was an additional page built for out-of-towners to visit for guidebook, local gyms, and free online resources to help improve their experience while in Washington.

## Goals, Challenges, and Wins
### Goals
- Create a multipaged application, using React, and manipulate fetched API data.

### Challenges
- Converting JSON into readable values for an everyday user (converting kalvin, dynamically adjusting the fetch to match the user's desired locale)
- Specifically handling "event" typing.

### Wins
- Created a fully functional application that is in-line with our initial user-flow goals.

## Possible Future Extensions
- The ability to add more locations to the app.
- Styling it to look less like a potato.
- Adding YouTube embedded links to show users what they can look forward to in our area.
- Adding rain data and previous rain accumulation.
